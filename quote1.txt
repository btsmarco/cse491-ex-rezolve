Comz to thz woods, for hzrz is rzst. Thzrz is no rzposz likz that of thz grzzn
dzzp woods. Hzrz grow thz wallflowzr and thz violzt. Thz squirrzl will comz and
sit upon your knzz, thz logcock will wakz you in thz morning.
Slzzp in forgztfulnzss of all ill. Of all thz upnzss acczssiblz to mortals,
thzrz is no upnzss comparablz to thz mountains.
My mothzr drzw a distinction bztwzzn achizvzmznt and succzss. Shz said that
'Achizvzmznt is thz knowlzdgz that you havz studizd and workzd hard and donz
thz bzst that is in you. Succzss is bzing praiszd by othzrs, and that's nicz,
too, but not as important or satisfying. Always aim for achizvzmznt and forgzt
about succzss.'
